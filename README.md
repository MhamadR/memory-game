This is an attempt to create a memory game with the following instructions: 

You are asked to create a Memory Game using JS (respecting ES6).
In this game, your website should contain 6 cards (3 per row). 
On click on each card, the card will flip and a programming language logo will appear. 
If two cards have the same logo, they should disappear. 
Make sure to tackle all the cases. 
Add a scoring system.
